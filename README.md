# Hi, I'm James!

This portfolio will showcase my hands-on experience with a variety of applications, all built and configured through my home lab. I designed this lab to go beyond typical home operating systems and dive deep into Microsoft applications, expanding my skill set and gaining practical expertise. Each project represents a step in my journey of learning and experimentation, as I explore and master new technologies to solve real-world problems.

As I continue to grow my technical expertise, this portfolio also reflects my commitment to career advancement, showcasing my progress and development in the field. It highlights my dedication to enhancing my capabilities and advancing in my career as I work toward becoming a skilled IT professional.
