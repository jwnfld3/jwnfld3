# Hi, I'm James!

This portfolio will showcase my hands-on experience with a variety of applications, all built and configured through my home lab. I designed this lab to go beyond typical home operating systems and dive deep into Microsoft applications, expanding my skill set and gaining practical expertise. Each project represents a step in my journey of learning and experimentation, as I explore and master new technologies to solve real-world problems.

As I continue to grow my technical expertise, this portfolio also reflects my commitment to career advancement, showcasing my progress and development in the field. It highlights my dedication to enhancing my capabilities and advancing in my career as I work toward becoming a skilled IT professional.

## Home Lab
 My home lab is built around Hyper-V for virtualization, allowing the creation and management of multiple virtual machines.

***Windows Server Datacenter 2022:*** The server environment runs on Windows Server Datacenter 2022, providing a robust and scalable foundation for various services and configurations.

***Three Windows 11 Virtual Machines:*** These VMs simulate different use cases and environments, helping test configurations, deployments, and other IT experiments.
